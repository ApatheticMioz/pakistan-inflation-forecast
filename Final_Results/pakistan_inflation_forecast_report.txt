7. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
================================

Based on the analysis, the following conclusions can be drawn:

1. Model Performance: The Ridge model demonstrated the best performance
   in forecasting Pakistan's inflation, suggesting that the relationship between economic indicators and inflation are key to accurate forecasting.

2. Inflation Drivers: The analysis identified several key drivers of inflation in Pakistan,
   including exchange rates, global commodity prices, and monetary policy indicators.

3. Forecast Reliability: The models show reasonable accuracy on historical data,
   but forecasts should be interpreted with caution due to the inherent uncertainty
   in economic predictions, especially in volatile economic environments.

Recommendations for further analysis:

1. Incorporate additional variables such as fiscal indicators, remittances,
   and more detailed sectoral data to improve model accuracy.

2. Implement more sophisticated forecasting techniques for the predictor variables
   to improve the accuracy of regularization model forecasts.

3. Consider ensemble methods that combine the strengths of different modeling approaches
   to potentially improve forecast accuracy.

4. Update the models regularly as new data becomes available to maintain forecast accuracy.
