1. BASIC INFORMATION
Dataset: CPI (Consumer Price Index)
Description: Year-on-Year percentage change in CPI, our target variable for forecasting
Dimensions: 106 rows, 9 columns
Time period: 2016-07-31 to 2025-04-30 (105 months)

2. DETAILED STATISTICS
Min: 0.3

Mean: 11.89096 
Median: 8.615 
Standard Deviation: 9.041975 
Quartiles:
      0%      25%      50%      75%     100% 
 0.30000  5.56500  8.61500 12.89683 38.00000 

Distribution characteristics:
Skewness: 1.239434 (Positive values indicate right skew, negative values indicate left skew)
Kurtosis: 3.438824 (Values > 3 indicate heavy tails compared to normal distribution)
Shapiro-Wilk normality test p-value: 1.212353e-09 - Distribution is significantly different from normal 

3. TIME SERIES PROPERTIES
Seasonal decomposition:
- Trend component range: 4.72625 30.95417 
- Seasonal component range: -0.3363769 0.4058979 
- Random component range: -4.406993 7.886277 
- Seasonal strength (max-min): 0.7422748 
- Trend strength (max-min): 26.22792 

Stationarity tests:
- Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test p-value: 0.9639448 - Series appears non-stationary 
- KPSS Test p-value: 0.01 - Series appears non-stationary 

Autocorrelation analysis:
- Ljung-Box Test p-value: 0 - Significant autocorrelation present 
- Significant autocorrelation at lags: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 

4. IMPLICATIONS FOR MODELING
Based on the analysis above, the following considerations are important for modeling:
- The series appears non-stationary based on the ADF test. Consider differencing or transformation before ARIMA modeling.
- Limited seasonality detected. Simple ARIMA models may be sufficient.
- Significant autocorrelation present. ARIMA models should capture this temporal dependence.
- Non-normal distribution detected. Consider robust estimation methods or transformations.
