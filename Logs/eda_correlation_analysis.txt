===== IMPLICATIONS FOR MODELING =====
Based on the correlation analysis, consider the following for modeling:
1. Strong contemporaneous correlations with CPI:
    exchange_rate, m2 
   These variables should be considered as key predictors in regression models.

2. Variables with significant lead/lag relationships:
   -  policy_rate : Maximum correlation at lag 2 months
   -  exchange_rate : Maximum correlation at lag -12 months
   -  oil_price : Maximum correlation at lag 11 months
   -  food_index : Maximum correlation at lag 1 months
   -  industrial_production : Maximum correlation at lag 8 months
   Consider including these variables with appropriate lags in your models.

3. For ARIMAX and regression models:
   - Include variables with strong correlations as exogenous predictors
   - Consider using lagged values based on the lag analysis
   - For variables with changing correlation patterns, consider including interaction terms

4. For regularized regression (Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net):
   - Include all variables, even those with moderate correlations
   - The regularization will automatically select the most relevant predictors
   - Include various lags to allow the model to select the optimal lag structure
