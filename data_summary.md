## Overview
This report summarizes CSV datasets from the subdirectory: `Data`.
**Format Assumption:** All datasets are assumed to be in **Tall format** (Rows=Time/Obs, Columns=Series/Attrs) and are analyzed as is (no transposition performed).
**Content:** Includes metadata, basic info, memory usage, missing values, unique values, value counts, distribution stats, correlation summary, and a **detailed summary table for every column (series/attribute)**.
Metadata sourced from `datasets_info.md` in `D:\work\Semester4\AdvStats\pakistan-inflation-forecast`.
The 'Data Sample' section shows **500 random rows (time points/observations)** across **all columns**.
